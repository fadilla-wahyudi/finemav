# *FineMAV*
This stand-alone program implements the Fine-Mapping of Adaptive Variation (*FineMAV*) statistic for detection of positively selected variants.

The *FineMAV* score of the derived allele for each SNP is calculated by multiplying three metrics:

- Derived allele purity -- measure of population differentiation that ranges from 0 to 1, where a score of 1 indicates that all the derived alelles fall into a single population. 
- Derived allele frequency 
- The Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion PHRED-scaled C-score (CADD_PHRED) -- a measure of functionality
